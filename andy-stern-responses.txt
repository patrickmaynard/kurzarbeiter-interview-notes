-- I am writing about how rather than offering an emergency UBI, some EU countries are instead mimicking Germany's "Kurzarbeitergeld" system, in which the government pays employers to pay their partially laid-off workers around 60% of normal pay for a limited time. What advantages and disadvantages can you think of for a system like this, as opposed to a UBI?

-- What are the advantages of a UBI specifically as it relates to preventing the spread of COVID-19?

UBI which is paid to workers give them complete control over decisions about their health, social distancing, and ability to care for the family.

If if employers are put in charge they will be a incentive or at least an inclination to try to get the company’s work done over the needs of workers  families,  health,  children, elders, etc.

-- Are countries that go for Kurzarbeitergeld rather than a UBI missing any key opportunities? How so?

First of all employer based funding is often excluding a significant portion of the formal workforce who are self-employed, gig workers or care workers. Not to mention the informal, not to mention the informal workforce and undocumented immigrant workforce Second the system is  providing no relief to families taking care of other family members. Third and employer based system is creating issues of compliance, recording, accounting, and accountability, and  it is hard to manage throughout the wide span of businesses in the country

-- Does a system like Kurzarbeitergeld, which is designed to keep employer-employee relationships intact, potentially keep people from moving to other opportunities? What are some ramifications of this?

Clearly tying a workers relationship to an employer, particularly in times of crisis, clearly reduces their liberty, Independence, and ability to make decisions about training or new employment. Individuals should have the freedom to control their own destiny not to have employment and life choices  tied to the whims of employers which can vary in terms of motivation, respect, honesty, and flexibility

-- Some people have said that Kurzarbeitergeld keeps employers from simply laying off most of their workers, then selectively rehiring at lower staffing levels after a crisis has passed, and that a UBI doesn't do that. Do you agree? 

I have not seen the evidence of that, and I’m not sure what prevents employers from reducing the workforce even if employees are kept on temporarily for Kurzarbeitergeld. Clearly in unionized work places lower wage workforce substitution will not happen, and, in addition, in crisis situations like a pandemic,  we can condition financial  support for employers, whether loans or grants, on rehiring the existing workforce at the same wages and benefits for a period of time. 

-- Regardless of whether a country goes with Kurzarbeitergeld or a UBI, what happens when the viral infections start to decline and the payments stop? 

Clearly getting the economy back to a historical level of functioning will take time, and here there may be need to give companies or individuals help on a more selective basis. 

-- Kurzarbeitergeld has existed since the early 1900s. When did the idea of UBIs become something that people advocated for?

UBI in our country dates back to Thomas Paine who wanted to give each American $10 in recognition of the land that was being reclaimed by the government after the revolutionary war. In the US it arose again with President Nixon and Milton Friedman, and then with the advocacy of Martin Luther King.

In recent years union leaders like myself and political leaders like Andrew Yang along with newly created think tanks like the Economic Security Project has brought the issue to the forefront of American discussions. In the UK, and throughout Europe, there’s always been constant  historical academic support for UBI,  and as inequality has increased, and  the market failing to share success of the country broadly,  people are raising it again as a viable option. 

-- How does Europe's existing social safety net act as an advantage when choosing remedies for the virus-related economic slowdown? Are there any ways in which it acts as a disadvantage?

It is clearly an advantage to have non-employer based social benefits, particularly healthcare in place. In addition guaranteed sick leave, a universal unemployment system, childcare provisions, and no student loans of the proportion that American students have is an incredible advantage in developing a strategy to respond to an economic crisis

-- Pivoting slightly: In which city are you currently physically located? What kinds of effects have you seen from the virus there?

I am in the epicenter of the crisis, New York City. I am watching a very effective Governor Cuomo show real leader ship, but the lack of support for healthcare workers and first responders, as well as an adequate healthcare infrastructure is creating devastating problems. The Failure of the national government to step in and move health care supplies Tom The areas most in need is disgraceful.  The city is basically locked down, I have been in my home for 11 days straight not leaving other than to walk in the park, in the sense that the virus is still spreading given how much stress there is currently on the healthcare system is quite frightening
